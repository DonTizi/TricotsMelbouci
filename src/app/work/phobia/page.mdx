## Collaborative Creativity

Your vision is our blueprint. In the Design Guidance phase, we delve into a dialogue with you to uncover your preferences and creative aspirations. 

Our goal is to understand precisely how you envision your product, advising you on the best textile choices, from the type of wool to the intricacies of design. 

By presenting pre-made models, we hone in on what resonates with you and what doesn't, ensuring the final product is a true reflection of your desired aesthetic.

## Design Advice
Elevate your textile vision. When guiding your design process, we draw upon our extensive knowledge to suggest the ideal yarns and design techniques that will bring your concept to life. 

Whether it's the luxurious touch of baby alpaca or the elegance of cashmere, our guidance is crafted to align with your creative intent. 

We're here to navigate the myriad of choices with you, making your design journey as seamless as your creations.
